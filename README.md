 Treehouse Techdegree Project 3: Online Registration Form

The purpose of this project was to practice HTML and CSS and show mastery of building blocks of the web by building a responsive, mobile-friendly registration form. Project starter files consisted of mockup images for mobile and desktop screen sizes. I was tasked with building a mobile and desktop version of the form using media queries and a "mobile-first" approach.

The basic requirements of this project included: building the HTML and CSS for this project myself using mobile-first design; creating a form to practice with the form field types in the lesson--text, email, and telephone input, select menu, checkboxes, radio buttons, textarea, and submit button; displaying proper knowledge of form element attributes such as id, type, name, placeholder, etc; displaying mastery of labels for form elements; using media queries for wider screen sizes; practicing with Google Fonts; adding focus states to the form; practicing spotting errors with code validators prior to submitting project.

The extra credit requirements of this project included: adding additional placeholder text for other text fields than the prior requirement stated, using the 'required' attribute to add HTML5 validation to make sure that required fields are filled out and formatted correctly; adding extra styling to the page by changing the background color for at least one of the main sections of the stie; using CSS transitions for focus states. 

I went beyond the requirements listed above by changing the styling for multiple elements; adding placeholder text for all input fields; using CSS transitions for all elements with focus states, including submit button; making sure my website was responsive at breakpoints 320px, 768px, 1024px and wider.
